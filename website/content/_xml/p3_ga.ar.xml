      <p><location>New York City, New York</location> Early Monday morning, at Trump Hotel,
                our newly elected president is preparing a speech for one of the most holiest of
                holidays in the United States. A local corresponder managed to get <source type="person">Mr. Trump</source> on the phone for a short interview to discuss
                what the think tank Mr. Trump works with has come up for Thanksgiving. Coming after
                the much talked about cabinet proceedings, <source type="person"> Mr. Trump</source>
                is on the hotseat for what seems to be ill-recieved choices in representation.
                    At dissent at
                an all time high, this holiday couldn't have come at a better time for <source type="person">Mr. Trump.</source> This holiday is a time for respect,
                appreciation of what we are given and a time to celebrate what unites us as
                Americans. However, Thanksgvinging is also a time to pardon some turkeys, as is
                tradition for the president in the White House. When asked about his plans in the
                upcoming Thanksgiving holiday where he will reside as President, <source type="person">Mr. Trump</source> was quoted saying, "Well, it's going to be
                great. It's going to be better than before. We are going to have the best turkeys.
                Only the biggest turkeys and, they will be huge. The turkeys I pardon will be
                    huge."<quote/></p>
