    <greeting>Hello,</greeting>
    <intro_para><intent type="purpose">I am very interested applying for the Foundry Operations Co-op at
                Ginkgo BioWorks.</intent><intent type="connection">Last year, I had spoken with representatives of the company at
                a Northeastern University Biotechnology career event, and had proceeded through to a
                phone interview with a member of the company thereafter, but was deferred due to
                lack of experience at the time (as it would have been my first co-op).</intent><reason>I am still extremely interested in the type of work that Ginkgo is doing, and
                the doors it will unlock for further biotechnological innovation,</reason> and
                <proposition>I believe that an opportunity to work at Ginkgo in Spring 2017 would
                allow for me to both make a noticeable contribution to the team and work being done,
                as well as provide a unique and powerful learning and skill-development experience
                as I strive to further develop my competency in this field.</proposition></intro_para>

      <experience type="school">Through my Bioengineering coursework, with a concentration in
                Cell and Tissue Engineering, I have gained an understanding of genetics, tissue
                mechanics, proteomics, and cellular engineering. I continue to pursue opportunities
                to learn more about the science and find creative ways to apply this knowledge,
                through conversations with peers and teachers</experience>
      <experience type="personal">and by reading about advances and research being done in my
                spare time.  While on campus, I have volunteered my time in two
                research labs, <skills>developing and executing mechanical engineering
                    experiments</skills> in the Bubble Imaging Lab and <skills>learning cell
                    culture/passaging, transfection, and biological assay techniques</skills> in the
                Addiction Sciences Lab, which I continue to be involved with. When not doing
                research, I serve as a mentor with multiple organizations on campus, further
                developing <skills>strong interpersonal and leadership skills that enable my ability
                    to lead groups and harness initiative.</skills></experience>

      <experience type="work">At my first co-op, I gained experience in a neurobiological
                research setting at Duke Universtiy, gaining proficiency with
                    <programs>MatLab</programs> and familiarity with <programs>python</programs> to
                    <accomplishments>develop an automated animal behavior training

                    imaging</skills> experiments. Throughout this experience, I gained <skills>
                    skill and experience with both digesting and writing technical
                    documentation,</skills> as well as developed ways to <skills>abstract simple
                    meaning and explanation of technical concepts.</skills> At the end of my co-op,
                    <accomplishments>I gave an hour-long comprehensive presentation of my work with
                    both animal behavior and calcium imaging to the entire lab in a lab

      <compatability>My coursework in genetic and protein engineering, as well as my
                experience using coding to automate existing processes while on my previous co-op,
                would allow me to succeed as a Foundry Operations Co-op at Ginkgo. I believe that
                this relevant experience, as well as my extreme interest in the work being
                done/potential applications of the technological paradigm being developed at Ginkgo
                and my personal qualities, would make this a great fit. </compatability>

      <next_step>I eagerly await your call at 1-800-666-5555 so that we can discuss possible
                next steps and answer questions about moving forward.</next_step>
