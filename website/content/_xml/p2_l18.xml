    <greeting>Hello Mathworks,</greeting>
    <intro_para>
      <intent type="Purpose">I am interested in the C++ Software Engineer job posted on
                LinkedIn.</intent>
      <reason><!-- Optional --> I have enjoyed my work with C++ in the past and I think
                Mathworks provides valuable tools for numerous technical professions.</reason>
      <proposition>I look forward to solving interesting problems in a high paced
                enviroment.</proposition>

      <experience type="work">I bring previous experience with <programs>C++ 11</programs>
                from my work at RKF Engineering. I used C++ while contributing to their satellite
                communication simulations. There I became familiar with
                    <skills>multithreading</skills> techniques. I also was one of the main testers
                in the company so I both have experience in <skills>debugging</skills> and reporting
                bugs.</experience>
      <experience type="school">I have used <programs>MATLAB</programs> before in my classes,
                so I appreciate the work Mathworks does. Your Simulink software in particular has
                been helpful: one of my more memorable school projects used in in the
                    <accomplishments>controls for a robotic arm</accomplishments>.</experience>

    <para_closing>
      <compatability>I think I will fit in well with Mathworks, and</compatability>
      <next_step>I hope we can further discuss what I can do for Mathworks.</next_step>
