    <greeting>Hello Mr.Morrissey,</greeting>
    <intro_para><intent type="purpose">I am interested in the Software Engineering job at EMC
                Corporation.</intent><intent type="connection"/> I became interested in the job, after searching the job
            position on NEU COOL. Although my major is information science, I took all the computer
            science classes in college and I meet the requirments of the computer knowledge for this
                job.<reason> I have enjoyed my past work at EMC in the position of ADS testing in
                Hopkinton, </reason> and <proposition>I think I will fit well with EMC's culture and
                bring all the necessary abilities to go above and beyond my job
                requirements.</proposition></intro_para>
    <para_background>
      <experience type="work">I bring previous experience with <programs>Iron
                    Python</programs> from my work at EMC in spring 2016 for my second co-op. As I
                mentioned before, I worked at Advanced Design Services group and I coded in
                    <programs>Iron Python</programs> to <accomplishments>test the newest servers and
                        equipments.</accomplishments> Our group, ADS, is a sub-team in DFx which
                stands for Design For X and my boss Dick Miller is the manager of the team. In this co-op, I had<accomplishments>developed a loop testing in Cumulus platform and it had been used by ADS to Qual
                    Testware and will be used for Debug. </accomplishments>I also earned a
                    <certifications>Bronze Award</certifications> for this. <accomplishments>In
                    processing of developing the test sequence, I took the initiative to contact and
                    work with the Cumulus Software Dev team in Shanghai to compelete it.
                </accomplishments> Besides the developing of the loop sequence, <accomplishments>I also developed the
                    test for POST analyzer for Infinity/Arcus.</accomplishments> In the last month
                of my co-op, my role was changed from a software developer to a SQA.
                    <accomplishments>I did the SQA job to release the tests for Infinity/Arcus by
                    running tests on all the Warthogs and fixing the software or potential hardware
                    problems with the team. </accomplishments><accomplishments>I worked hard and communicated with dev groups from Shanghai, Cork
                    and Franklin. Since all work is not done by one person, it's important to have
                    the team work ability to accomplish the work.</accomplishments> Besides the work, I
                attended the derating class and the IPMI class while I was working at EMC. I also
                attended the 3D printing workshop which was held in UMASS Lowell. I really enjoyed
                working at EMC because the EMC community has many events for employees from
                different cultures. There were Ping Pong competitions and lion dance during the
                Chinese New Year in February. These events help me put myself as a part of the EMC
                    community.</experience>

      <experience type="work">I had my first co-op at Harvard School of Public
                Health in IT services, spring 2015. In this co-op, I <accomplishments>developed
                    strong customer service skills by troubleshooting usersâ€™ software and hardware
                    problems. I communicated with customers by emails, phones and in-person. Because most of my
                    customers are not experts in computer, I need to explain the reason of causing the problem and the way to
                    prevent it. </accomplishments> I also <accomplishments>collaborated with team to
                    manage helpdesk responsibilities and customer issues</accomplishments>. These
                experience helped me gain communication skills by facing different
                people.</experience>
      <experience type="school">Aside from my work experience, I learned
                    <programs>C++</programs>, <programs>Java</programs>, <programs>C</programs>, and
                    <programs>XML</programs> from my courses at Northeastern University which is a
                perfect fit for this job as a software engineer.</experience>

    <closing_statements>
      <compatability>Because of the previous work at EMC and my computer science knowledge, I
                think I will fit in well with the culture of EMC Corporation and this job
                    position.</compatability>
      <next_step>I hope you will call me at 857-222-0943 so that we can discuss the next step
