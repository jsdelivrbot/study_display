    <greeting>Dear Mr. Sarkisian,</greeting>
    <intro_para><intent type="purpose">I am interested in applying for a summer internship position
                within the structural engineering group at Skidmore, Owings and Merrill during the
                summer of 2017.</intent><intent type="connection">After speaking with you over the phone this past summer about
                the different opportunities at SOM, I became increasingly interested in pursuing a
                job within the engineering department.</intent><reason>I have a strong interest in both architecture and structural
                engineering</reason> and <proposition>I think I would be a great fit with the SOM
                culture. I have the necessary technical skills and passion for learning that would
                help me to succeed in a fast paced environment.</proposition></intro_para>
    <para_background>
      <experience type="personal">Growing up I was exceedingly interested in the study of
                architecture and the design of the built environment. However it was not until late
                in highschool that I realized that my interests were more technical in nature. </experience>
      <experience type="school">Now in my fourth year at Northeastern University I am pursuing
                a master's degree in civil engineering with a focus in structural.<accomplishments>
                    I have taken courses in both the technical aspects of engineering and design as
                    well as on the history of architecture in America.</accomplishments></experience>
      <experience type="work">Entering into the industry I did not realize how isolated each
                of the different companies working on a project could be. In the past two years I
                have co-oped with two different companies within the building industry. With Skanska
                I <accomplishments>developed a better understanding of the technical and
                    coordination aspects involved with the construction of a project.</accomplishments> While working at Simpson Gumpertz
                and Heger I was able to apply my <skills>technical knowledge from classes</skills>
                and improve my design skills with programs such as <programs>AutoCAD, Revit and RAM
                    Steel.</programs> Ultimately I hope to one day use my technical background and
                project management skills to bring the separate groups together to work as a
                cohesive unit under each project.</experience>
    </para_background>
    <closing_statements>
      <compatability> For these reasons I think I will fit in well with the holistic design
                culture of SOM.</compatability>
      <next_step>I have attached my resume to this letter and I hope to hear from you in the
                future regarding possible opennings for interns in the Summer of 2017.</next_step>
    </closing_statements>
