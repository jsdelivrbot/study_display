      <experience type="work">Throughout my three co-ops at Northeastern University, I was
                able to hone my <programs>AutoCAD and Excel</programs> skills in a manner that
                increased the efficiency of my work as well as that of my peers'.
                    <programs>Excel</programs> proved to be increasingly useful <accomplishments>as
                    I recognized areas of inneficiency within my previous companies'
                    workflow</accomplishments> and <accomplishments>was able to develop macros to
                    automate previously manual processes.</accomplishments></experience>
      <experience type="school"> At Northeastern, I gained <skills>technical
                    communication</skills> skills from my work within the Sustainable Energy Systems
                minor. Through various projects within the graduate classes associated with this
                program I was able to utilize the knowledge gained in my earlier classes as well as
                on my co-ops to work towards unique solutions to proposed issues. Advanced classes
                within this minor evaluated the leglislative, economic, and environmental issues
                assocated with solar energy.</experience>
      <experience type="school"> My capstone project at Northeastern will
                allow me to improve my <skills>ability to communicate effectively with various
                    specialists</skills> working towards a common goal. Our project goal, to design
                a potable water distribution system as well as an energy generation facility in
                Haiti, will give me the opportunity to communicate with environmental and electric
                specialists as I fill the role of solar development specialist. </experience>
