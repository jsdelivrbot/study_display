      <intro>
        <p>Movie reviews help many people decide on whether or not they should go see a
                    movie that they are interested in. <genre>They are a part of the larger review
                        genre which exists because people enjoy sharing their opinions on products
                        and many find it helpful to know other’s opinions when deciding on
                        something. Professional reviews still have the personal opinion of the
                        reviewer, but they also give an objective view on the product in an attempt
                        to not have the review be completely bias. Movie reviews generally go over the plot, the actors’
                        performances, the soundtrack, and the visuals.</genre> Many times if those
                    aspects of the movie are good, the reviewer’s personal opinion of the movie will
                    be positive and vice versa. Traditionally reviews are written, but with websites
                    such as YouTube there are now many reviews that are recorded and posted
                    as videos. <argument type="main">These written reviews and video reviews are
                        both very similar, being part of the same genre, but they have a few key
                        differences that separate them. Video reviews almost feel like a
                        conversation with the reviewer due to the viewer being able to see and hear
                        the reviewer, although it is a one-way conversation. Written reviews do not
                        have this luxury and so they go into more detail about the different aspects
                        of the movie and how well the reviewer believes they worked.</argument><situation>One way to see these similarities and differences is to look at two
                        positive reviews of the movie “Star Wars: The Force Awakens”, one written by
                        Anthony Lane and the other a video created by Chris Stuckmann. “Star Wars:
                        The Force Awakens” was a highly anticipated movie due to the popularity of
                        the franchise, so a lot of work went into the many reviews made about it.
                        These two reviews also try to look at the movie objectively while still
                        giving personal opinions.</situation></p>
      </intro>
      <bodyPara><sim>Both the written review and the video review follow the movie review genre.</sim><genre>They talk about the general plot of the movie and how it was interesting. The
                    reviews go over how the effects and CGI look great while not being the focus and
                    how the sounds were great.</genre> With the newest entry in the Star Wars
                franchise having many new faces in its cast, both reviews talk a lot about the
                actors and how well they performed. <sim>Both reviewers loved the main protagonist
                    Rey</sim>, played by Daisy Ridley. “She straps herself in, swats aside any
                vestige of Mark Hamill, and takes command of the movie” <citation>(Lane)</citation>.
                Stuckmann said that “she steals the entire film”. <sim>They both liked many of the
                    new actors as well as the actors from the original Star Wars trilogy, namely
                    Harrison Ford in the role of Han Solo. Both reviews mention the soundtrack and
                    visuals being gorgeous. They mention that the movie “feels young”
                        <citation>(Lane)</citation>, that it is modern and fast paced in contrast to
                    slower pace of past Star Wars movies. Lane mentions one scene being “a feast for
                    the ears as well as the eyes, for it unfolds in a wintry forest. In addition to
                    the usual throbbing hum of the weapons, you can hear the sizzle of sabre on
                    snow, and the slicing hiss as the fighters miss their target and fell
                    surrounding pine trees by mistake”. He calls this “genuine cinematic texture”
                    that he says was missing from previous films <citation>(Lane)</citation>.
                    Stuckmann goes over this same point when he mentions that the movie “actually
                    feels like a movie” <citation>(Stuckmann)</citation>. The reviewers also go over
                    the director of the movie, J.J. Abrams, and how he did a great job with the
                    movie reassuring fans that the franchise is in good hands. <genre>Both reviews
                        talk about it all; the plot, the director, the cast, the soundtrack, the
                        visuals and more. They go over everything that the movie review genre calls
                        for in a review.</genre> That is how they are similar.</sim> But these two
                reviews still have differences, mainly the obvious one. <diff>One is a video of
                    someone talking about the movie and the other is just text.</diff> The written
                review has everything it needs to be in the movie review genre and that is all. The
                video review has a lot more. <diff>With the viewer being able to see and hear the
                    reviewer talk, a video review feels a lot more personal than just reading
                        words. Seeing
                    their face and hearing their voice, the viewer can feel like they actually know
                    the reviewer as a person. In Stuckmann’s video review, the viewers can hear how
                    excited he is to be talking about the movie. His friendly tone of voice being
                    able to see his facial expressions also help the viewer trust his opinion more.
                    It is incredibly easy to tell that Stuckmann loved the movie and is excited to
                    talk about it. Watching his video review is almost like hearing a trusted
                    friend’s opinion instead of the opinion of some faceless movie
                    critic.</diff></bodyPara>
      <concl>
        <p>
          <sim>There are many similarities between the written and video movie reviews.
                        They are both perfect examples of the movie review genre.</sim>
          <diff>But the video review is more approachable because of the fact that it is a
                        video that lets the viewer see who the reviewer is.</diff>
          <genre>The movie review genre is clearly defined by these two reviews. It is
                        also easy to see how they fit in the overarching review genre. Despite the
                        differences between the written review and the video review, they are still
                        both a part of both the movie review genre and the review genre.</genre>
