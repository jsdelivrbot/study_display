      <compatability>EMCOR is one of the leading mechanical contractors in the Boston metropolitan area. 
                After my previous experience with HVAC controls, I am looking to broaden my skills in mechanical 
                contracting and I believe working at EMCOR would be a challenging and rewarding path to new 
                knowledge in the industry. I trust that I would be a driven candidate capable of taking on the 
                adversity and problem solving needed when in the office or out in the field. </compatability>
      <next_step><pb/>I am eager to start my future in the HVAC industry and appreciate your consideration for 
                a position at EMCOR Northeast. I look forward to hearing from you soon.</next_step>
