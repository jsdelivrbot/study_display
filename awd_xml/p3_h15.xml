      <experience type="work">I currently work at Northeastern Universityâ€™s ReGame VR Lab,
                which leverages video games for motor rehabilitation. Here, <skills>I develop Unity
                    games</skills> in <skills>C#</skills> for two platforms: the <programs>Microsoft
                    Surface tablet</programs> and another that uses the <programs>Microsoft
                    Kinect</programs>. Our games are targeted towards children with
                cerebral palsy and aim to engage and encourage patients during therapy. I enjoy the
                work I do here as it makes me feel that I am making a big difference, and I believe
                I will be able to contribute to Filament Games with a similar drive.

      <experience type="school">From my coursework towards a BA in Computer Engineering at

      <experience type="personal">One of my current projects is a turn-based strategy game
                created in Unity that uses procedural generated maps and the A* pathfinding
                algorithm for unit movements. Development stages of this project along with my other
                personal projects highlighting the principles and topics outlined above can be
