    <page type="exec_sum"> The system outlined in this study is a distributed method for the
            collection of weather-related data. The system consists of a network of
            micro-controllers with attached sensors to measure temperature and pressure. Associated
            with this system is a web application for the viewing and acquisition of collected data.
            The distributed nature of the system allows for a more granular view of weather data,
            allowing for better reporting and prediction of weather patterns. In addition, this
            system will attempt to be as open as possible as to effect the best possible analysis.
            <pb/> Based on preliminary research, this project is feasible. </page>

      <app_ovr type="obj"> The primary functionality provided is a system that collects
                weather data, specifically temperature and pressure, in a highly distributed manner.
                Micro-controllers will host the sensors that directly collect data; they will also
                contain networking functionality in order to send data to a centralized database.
                The data will be exposed to the public via a web application. Features provided by
                the web application include direct download of the data and visualizations based on
                the data. </app_ovr>

      <fsb_hlgt type="tcnl" n="1"> This project has two broad components, the sensor and the web applications. The
                sensor portion is composed of a micro-controller and multiple sensors. The
                micro-controller will also have some form of network connection and possibly some
                form of rudimentary data filtering mechanism. Network connectivity will be in the
                form of an ad-hoc network between all of the devices, with certain devices used as
                "exit nodes" which connect to the internet at large in order to upload to a central
                database and, by extension, the web application. Sensors to be included are for
                temperature (thermometer) and pressure (barometer). Data sent to the central
                database will be a timestamp, location data, and the data collected by the sensors.
                The web application is build on top
                of a database containing the data sent from the sensors. The two main features for
                the web application are data download and visualization creation. </fsb_hlgt>

                    platform, essentially a small computer which provides power to all of the other

                    prune noise from the collected data. </req><req n="2" title="Network Connectivity">The sensors will be connected via an ad-hoc

                    Pre-programed into each unit, will be the routing data which provides a path to
                    a unit that has connection to the actual internet (an "exit node"). Thus, each
                    unit will push its data towards the unit that is "closer" to an "exit node"
                    until the data is pushed to the database. </req><req n="3" title="Temperature Sensor">A basic thermometer, this will collect the

      <est type="fnc"> This sensors could use
                many commercial off the shelf products. For the micro-controller, an Arduino based
                chip could be used. These kinds of controllers are widely available and have the
                additional advantage of being open-source. The cheapest appropriate model would be
                rather expensive at fifteen to twenty dollars, but that price could go down as the
                boards are bought in bulk. Sensors provided by the Arduino project could also be
                used. A temperature sensor costs around one dollar and fifty cents and a pressure
                sensor costs around five dollars. Both of these prices, as with the chip, could go
                down with bulk purchases. The most expensive piece of equipment to buy would be
                network connectivity module, which would likely cost more than twenty dollars.
                Assuming a cost of twenty dollars for both the chip and the network module, this
                adds up to an overall cost of about forty seven dollars per unit. This price seems
                quite restrictive on the surface, but the price could decrease with bulk pricing
                and/or the possible development of specialized micro-controllers. </est>

    <page type="rsk_ana"> Potential risks to this system include, but are not limited to, loss
            of funding and public disinterest in the project. These two
            risks are intertwined as each can lead to the other. Mitigating the risk of public
            disinterest could be achieved by hiring a public relations firm to create and/or
            maintain enthusiasm for a distributed weather system. <pb/> Causes of funding loss for
            the project depend on the actual source of said funding. If most of the financing for the
            project is public, disinterest in the project is a likely cause, which was discussed in
            the previous paragraph. If funding is generally private, the causes are numerous and
            mitigation strategies more nebulous and possibly less effective. Again, a downturn in
            public opinion could reduce funding. The most general and likely cause of private
            funding loss is the fiscal state of the company providing funding. Once a downturn of
            the funding company has started, it is out of the hands of the executors of this
            project. The only real way to reduce this risk is to choose a funding company that
            stable for the foreseeable future. </page>

      <fsb> Based on preliminary research, this project seems to be technologically feasible.
                From a practical perspective, these systems should be designed to be deployed in
                small segments, e.g., a neighborhood, as deploying in a entire city at one time
                would be fiscally and technically challenging.</fsb>
      <cond> The main hurdle to any actual implementation of this project is funding. A
                significant amount of the funding to this project would likely need to be public.
                The need for public funding necessitates a campaign in order to drum up general
                support for this project. </cond>
      <sum> This is a project that would provide more granular and open granular weather data.
                The described implementation is made of commercially available, common parts. This
                system is quite feasible in the current environment. </sum>
