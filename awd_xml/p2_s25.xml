    <greeting>Dear Joshua Elvander,</greeting>
    <intro_para>
      <intent type="purpose">I am writing to express my interest in the mechanical engineering
                fall internship position, which I found through Northeastern's co-op
                network.</intent>
      <reason> I am approaching my fourth year as a BS/MS candidate for Mechanical Engineering
                with a concentration in Mechatronics and am eager to gain more hands-on experience
                in new industries.</reason>
      <proposition>I believe my previous experience and passion for automation and
                interdisciplinary work make me an ideal candidate for this role.</proposition>
    </intro_para>
    <para_background>
      <experience type="work">During my time at Portal Instruments, another start up in the
                area, I worked on a <accomplishments>complex electromechanical assembly, which was
                    later used as a in human studies for a needle-free drug delivery
                    device.</accomplishments> This project involved a lot of independent
                    <skills>design, fabrication, and testing,</skills> which I believe is not unlike
                the work I would be doing at Piaggio. At my last co-op at Bio-Rad, <accomplishments>I worked mostly
                    independently on a piece of automation equipment, meant to automate a complex
                    manufacturing process of a DNA sequencing consumable.</accomplishments> This
                involved the integration of <skills>mechanical, electrical, and software
                    disciplines</skills>. Specifically, this meant extensive experience with
                    <skills>CAD design of precision parts, wiring,</skills> and
                    <programs>programming a TRIO motion controller.</programs></experience>
    </para_background>
    <para_background>
      <experience type="personal">In addition to my work experience, I also participate in
                AIAA, where I have begun to help with the <skills>mechanical design of an RC plane
                    as well as the electrical and software implementation of several
                    components.</skills> This involves more <skills>Solidworks design, as well as
                    learning how to read various sensors such as altimeters and gyroscopes using an
                    Arduino.</skills></experience>
    </para_background>
    <closing_statements>
      <compatability> My previous supervisors have described me as a self motivated worker
                with an eagerness to learn, which I believe would make me a great fit for the start up
                environment of Piaggio.</compatability>
      <next_step>I would appreciate an opportunity to meet with you to discuss my
                qualifications in further detail. </next_step>
      <acknowledgment>Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to speaking with
                you soon.</acknowledgment>
