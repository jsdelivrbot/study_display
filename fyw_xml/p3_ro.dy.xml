        <p>
          <synopsis type="plot_points">“Fargo” opens with Jerry Lundegaard, played by William H. Macy, meeting with
                    two crooks at a bar in Fargo, North Dakota. He plans to have the men kidnap 
                    his wife so he can split the ransom money with them from his wealthy father-in-law. 
                    The movie then continues with an amazing telling of how everything went wrong with 
                    Lundegaard’s plan. It stars the Minnesota police chief Marge Gunderson, played by 
                    Frances McDormand, who investigates what is going on when three people get killed 
                    as a result of the kidnapping going wrong.</synopsis>

        <p><opinions type="reaction"> The best part about the movie is the
                        characters.</opinions> All the actors did an amazing job in portraying their
                    character. Each character is believable and life-like. <context type="actor">William H. Macy especially did a great job with the character of Jerry
                        Lundegaard. It is easy to see the distress he is under from his plan falling
                        apart and how he still believes he can somehow pull it off even with
                        absolutely nothing going his way. You see how much trouble he has dealing
                        with all his problems, especially when he fails to call off the kidnapping
                        after realizing he might not need it.</context></p>
        <p>
          <context type="actor">The character of Marge Gunderson, the police chief
                        investigating the murders that followed the kidnapping, is another excellent
                        character. As the star of the movie, she portrays the “Minnesota nice”
                        stereotype, being friendly towards everyone she meets including those she
                        interrogates and arrests. </context>
          <opinions type="reaction">It was great
                        watching her intelligently piece together the case slowly up to the climax
                        of the film.</opinions>
        </p>
        <p><opinions type="reaction">The two men who kidnap Lundegaard’s wife were also
                        great characters.</opinions><context type="actor">Specifically Carl, played by Steve Buscemi. His character
                        brings a good amount of humor into the film even with the dark plotline. His
                        horrible attempt to deal with a state trooper, his conversations with his
                        partner, and his ineptness work together to make him a great
                        character.</context> Everytime witnesses refer to him, they are only able to
                    say that he was a “funny-looking guy”. </p>
        <p>
          <opinions type="reaction">Even small characters in the movie where great. They
                        really helped make the world of the film feel alive.</opinions>
          <context type="actor">Marge’s husband had a painting contest he was in where he
                        was trying to get one of his paintings on a stamp. He was also a sweet dude
                        and it seemed like they had a great marriage. He wakes up early with her
                        just to make her breakfast. Other characters with even fewer lines were
                        amazing, and every character had accents and said lines such as “Yah, you
                        betcha”.</context>
          <opinions type="reaction">The characters all worked together to make the movie
                        come to life, like this story really could have happened in some small towns
                        and suburbs in Minnesota.</opinions>
        </p>
        <p>
          <aesthetics>The movie also looked fantastic. There were no confusing shots and
                        you could see everything of importance in each one. Some wide shots were
                        especially beautiful, such as when Marge finally confronts the kidnappers on
                        a frozen lake. The aesthetics of it all were wonderful, and it was easy to
                        tell how cold and desolate the setting is just by the colors on screen and
                        all the snow.</aesthetics>
        </p>
        <p>The soundtrack also fit the movie perfectly. Each song went great with the scene
                    it played in, although there were no standout memorable songs. Most just added
                    to the scene to they were in to make it even better.</p>
        <p>
          <context type="director">The Coen Brothers did a great job directing “Fargo”.
                        They really captured the small town feel and told the story well with all
                        their decisions.</context>
          <opinions type="reaction">I enjoyed the move a lot and I believe it is just as
                        good as some of their other great films, such as “The Big
                        Lebowski”.</opinions>
        </p>
      </body>
      <conclusion>
        <p><opinions type="reaction">Overall, “Fargo” was a fantastic film.</opinions> There
                    is no question about how it was able to make <summary type="gross_income">$60
                        million at the box office on a budget of $7 million</summary>. <opinions type="reaction">It told a story realistically and did not try to answer
                        every question, leaving some things open ended just like they are in real
                        life. The characters were amazing and realistic and made the entire
                        movie.</opinions></p>
