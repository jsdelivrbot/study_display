# Writing in Markup Display Site
This is a repo for anonymized XML data generated in my dissertation research and for a site to display and interact with that data.

## Description
The XML files in this repository were generated in the summer and fall semesters of 2016 in two undergraduate writing courses: Advanced Writing for the Technical professions (summer) and First-year Writing (fall). Students in those classes collaboratively developed schema files based on genres of writing that they chose to research and produce. They then used those schemas to produce individual examples of their chosen genres, iteratively revising the schemas according to their experiences composing.
